function [projection_ind, I_info] = elf_project_image(I_info, azi, ele, method, rotation)
% ELF_PROJECT_IMAGE creates a projection index vector to transform a fisheye image into a equirectangular (azimuth/elevation) grid
%
% Inputs:
% I_info     - Image information structure (only uses Height, Width, SamplesPerPixel, FocalLength and Model)
% azi, ele   - output angle ranges defining the desired grid of the projected images (default -90:0.1:90, and 90:-0.1:-90)
% method     - The desired fisheye projection. Currently supports 'equisolid'(e.g. D810)/'orthographic'/'equidistant' 
% rotated    - 
%
% Outputs:
% projection_ind  - projections index matrix. The projected image can be calculated as im_proj = im(projection_ind)
% I_info          - Image information structure with projection grids added. These can be used in plotting.

% Uses: elf_project_rect2fisheye, which uses elf_project_sub2ind
